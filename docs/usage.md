# Usage guide

I've provided Python bindings to access the core features of the code. These are included in the `py` source folder. `main.py` includes bindings to some C++ functions and structs, as well as a `RuntimeManager` class capable of creating, running, and training simulated scenarios. `train.py` includes a `Trainer` class that expands on the training functionalities in `RuntimeManager` to make training a bit more robust.
